'''
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Follow up: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

                return nums[mid]
